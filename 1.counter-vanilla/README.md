### Concepts

* State loop

#### State loop pros

1. More concepts (not necessary good)
2. More reactive (do we often need reactivitiy THERE?)
3. Less worthless event (questionable)

#### State loop cons

1. More stream method calls instead of more plain function calls
2. More concepts (not necessary bad)
3. Additional imperative actions to make a loop
4. State + History requires an additional loop (not necessary)
