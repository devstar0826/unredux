# Unredux

**WIP**

## Motivation

Redux ecosystem is becoming incredibly complex. Bloated and overcomplicated to the level of Angular 1.0.
Many people are switching to Vue.js just because they are tired of adding new and new items to the
endless list of: React + Redux + Redux patterns + Redux Actions + Redux Thunks + Redux Sagas + ...

When you need tons of code to make a simple TODO app â€“ you're doing something wrong.
The point of this repo is to reimplement official Redux-Examples without Redux and to prove,
that it's actually easier to make React app without Redux than with it.

## Examples

1. [Counter Vanilla (no React)](./1.counter-vanilla)
2. [Counter A](./2.counter-a)
3. [Counter B](./3.counter-b)
4. [Todos](./4.todos)
5. [Todos + undo](./5.todos-with-undo)
6. [Todos "MVC"](./6.todos-mvc)

## Q-A

### Why not CycleJS?
