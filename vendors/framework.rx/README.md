Current intention is to copy this file into application as `framework.js` instead of `npm install`.

* Pros: easy to inspect and change in-place as necessary
* Cons: loosing auto-update "feature"

With a single comprehensible `framework.js` file, the above pros overweight the cons so it truly
becomes an *unframework* approach.
